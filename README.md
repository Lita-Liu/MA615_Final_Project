# MA615_Final_Project
Since the whole economic system is inextricably linked to nearly everything we do as a society, the global pandemic- COVID-19 has significantly impacted it, especially the stock market. The stock market began to recover after the first lock-down in early March 2020.
In this project, I choose stock from Nike, Procter & Gamble and The Walt Disney Company from July.1st,2020 to Dec.1st,2020. As the top appeal company, consumer goods company and entertainment and media company respectively, these three company all experience stock market crash influenced by COVID-19. I will perform stock analysis on a portfolio consisting of Nike, Procter & Gamble and The Walt Disney Company.
